# Oasis 🌴 - The automated plant watering system 💦
> An application designed to run on a Rasberry Pi that can automate the watering of plants. The Pi should be hooked up to a HAT, solenoid valve and reservoir. 
The user can create watering "jobs" and schedule them to run periodically. 
Future features may include integration with a weather service to influence watering frequency.

## Components (inc. planned):
- 🛠️ Oasis Service - A Spring Web service that provides the API.
- 💻 Oasis UI - A React based front end that will provide a user friendly way of creating and maintaining jobs
- 📱 Oasis Android App (TODO) - An application for Android devices that provides an Android native way of creating and maintaining jobs.
- 🕵🏿 Oasis Agent (TODO) - Manages and configures Python scripts that control the Pi itself. Will be controlled by the service.
